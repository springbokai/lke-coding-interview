    "When evaluating candidates, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and properly commented?\n",
    "2. **Technical Accuracy**: Are the methods implemented correctly?\n",
    "3. **Analytical Thinking**: Does the candidate show good understanding of the problem and data?\n",
    "4. **Visualization Skills**: Are the visualizations clear, appropriate, and insightful?\n",
    "5. **Machine Learning Knowledge**: Is there evidence of understanding model selection, training, and evaluation?\n",
    "6. **Business Acumen**: Can the candidate connect technical findings to business recommendations?"
